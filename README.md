# Accessible Command Line Utilities (ACLU) 

This repo contains utilities with a broad theme of making tasks developers often perform more efficient when using a screen reader.

#  askJira tool 

Every developer knows of the fundamental need to track work to be done on their project.  jira has become a defacto standard tool in the software developement industry.  Thus the first utility created is focused on using Jira. 

askJira was motivated by a need to interface with Jira in a more efficient way, especially when using a screen reader.  
It is primairily a command line tool for searching and presenting data from Jira in a more accessible way.  
That might be command line only with text as output, or web pages might be built with more of a focus on accessibility and navigation when using a screen reader.
